Day 1 - learn all the cpp basics but i haven't shown it here because it all the basics and everyone probably knows it.

Day 2 - trying to mastery the loops pattern 1 and pattern 2. i know its very slow but i really want to be expert in this so i am taking my time to mastery on this.

Day 3 - finally printed the pattern 3 and pattern 4 its again slow but i did it and i understood bot the patterns and i am heading off to the bed , bye good night.

Day 4 - finally printed the pattern 5 6 and 7. pattern 5 was easy and nice. pattern 6 was a little difficult .
